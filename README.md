## üìã Prerequisites

Before running this application, make sure you have the following installed:

- **Node.js** (>= 20.0.0) - JavaScript runtime
- **npm** or **yarn** - Package manager
- **Git** - Version control system

## üöÄ Installation

1. **Clone the repository:**
   ```bash
   git clone <repository-url>
   cd the-lab-academy
   ```

2. **Install dependencies:**
   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

3. **Set up environment variables:**

   Create a `.env` file in the root directory and configure the following variables:

   ```env
   # API Configuration
   VITE_API_URL=http://localhost:8000/api

   # Optional: Override default API settings
   VITE_API_TIMEOUT=15000
   VITE_API_MAX_RETRIES=3
   VITE_API_RETRY_BASE_DELAY=300
   VITE_API_RETRY_MAX_DELAY=5000

   # Development mode (set to 'DEBUG' to bypass authentication)
   VITE_MODE=development
   ```

## üèÉ Running the Application

### Development Mode

Start the development server with hot reload:

```bash
npm run dev
```

The application will be available at `http://localhost:5173` (default Vite port).

### Production Build

Build the application for production:

```bash
npm run build
```

Preview the production build locally:

```bash
npm run preview
```

The preview will be available at `http://localhost:3000`.

## üß™ Testing

Run the test suite:

```bash
# Run all tests
npm test

# Run tests with UI
npm run test:ui

# Run tests once (CI mode)
npm run test:run

# Run tests with coverage
npm run test:coverage
```

## üîß API Configuration

The application communicates with a backend API for data management. The API endpoints are documented in [`docs/api_endpoints.md`](docs/api_endpoints.md).

### Backend Requirements

The application expects a REST API with the following base URL structure:
- **Base URL**: `/api/v1`
- **Authentication**: JWT Bearer tokens
- **Content-Type**: `application/json`

### Key API Endpoints

- **Authentication**: `/api/v1/auth/*` - User registration, login, password reset
- **Courses**: `/api/v1/courses/*` - Course catalog and enrollment
- **Dashboard**: `/api/v1/dashboard/*` - User progress and enrolled courses
- **Lessons**: `/api/v1/lessons/*` - Lesson content and completion
- **Admin**: `/api/admin/*` - Content management (admin only)

### Development Setup

For local development, you'll need:

1. **Backend API Server** running on `http://localhost:8000`
2. **Database** (typically PostgreSQL with Supabase)
3. **Environment Variables** configured as shown above

## üö¢ Deployment

### Production Deployment

The application is configured for deployment on platforms like Vercel, Netlify, or any static hosting service.

1. **Build the application:**
   ```bash
   npm run build
   ```

2. **Deploy the `dist` folder** to your hosting provider.

### Environment Configuration

For production, set the following environment variables:

```env
VITE_API_URL=https://your-api-domain.com/api
VITE_MODE=production
```

### Reverse Proxy Setup

If deploying behind a reverse proxy (nginx, Apache), configure it to route `/api/*` requests to your backend server:

**nginx example:**
```nginx
server {
    listen 80;
    server_name your-domain.com;

    location / {
        root /path/to/built/app;
        try_files $uri $uri/ /index.html;
    }

    location /api/ {
        proxy_pass http://your-backend-server:8000;
        proxy_set_header Host $host;
        proxy_set_header X-Real-IP $remote_addr;
        proxy_set_header X-Forwarded-For $proxy_add_x_forwarded_for;
        proxy_set_header X-Forwarded-Proto $scheme;
    }
}
```
