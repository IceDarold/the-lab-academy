## Test Infrastructure Architecture

The test infrastructure consists of multiple layers:

- **Unit Tests**: Vitest for frontend components and utilities
- **Integration Tests**: Vitest with backend API integration
- **E2E Tests**: Playwright for full user journey testing
- **Visual Regression**: Automated screenshot comparison
- **Performance Tests**: Load and performance benchmarking
- **Accessibility Tests**: WCAG compliance validation
- **Chaos Engineering**: Error scenario and resilience testing
- **Backend Tests**: pytest for API and database testing

## Key Technologies

- **Frontend Testing**: Vitest, Playwright, axe-playwright
- **Backend Testing**: pytest, coverage
- **CI/CD**: GitHub Actions with parallel job execution
- **Reporting**: Custom dashboards and aggregated test results
- **Monitoring**: Alert system for test failures and performance regressions

## Support
