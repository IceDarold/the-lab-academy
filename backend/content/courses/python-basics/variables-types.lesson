# Variables and Data Types in Python

Variables are containers for storing data values. Python has several built-in data types that we'll explore in this lesson.
---
type: text
---
## Variables

A variable is created the moment you first assign a value to it:
---
type: code
language: python
---
# Variable assignment
name = "Alice"
age = 25
height = 5.7
is_student = True

print(name)  # Output: Alice
---
type: text
---
### Variable Naming Rules

- Must start with a letter or underscore
- Can contain letters, numbers, and underscores
- Case-sensitive (name â‰  Name)
- Cannot use Python keywords
---
type: text
---
## Data Types

### Numbers
---
type: code
language: python
---
# Integers
x = 5
y = -10

# Floating point
pi = 3.14159
temperature = -5.5

# Complex numbers
z = 3 + 4j
---
type: text
---
### Strings
---
type: code
language: python
---
# String literals
name = "Python"
message = 'Hello World!'

# Multi-line strings
poem = """Roses are red,
Violets are blue,
Python is awesome,
And so are you!"""

# String operations
first_name = "John"
last_name = "Doe"
full_name = first_name + " " + last_name  # "John Doe"
---
type: text
---
### Booleans
---
type: code
language: python
---
is_raining = True
is_sunny = False

# Boolean operations
result = 5 > 3  # True
is_adult = age >= 18  # Depends on age value
---
type: text
---
### Lists
---
type: code
language: python
---
# Creating lists
fruits = ["apple", "banana", "cherry"]
numbers = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]
mixed = [1, "hello", True, 3.14]

# Accessing elements
first_fruit = fruits[0]  # "apple"
last_number = numbers[-1]  # 5

# Modifying lists
fruits.append("orange")
fruits[1] = "blueberry"
---
type: text
---
### Dictionaries
---
type: code
language: python
---
# Creating dictionaries
person = {
    "name": "Alice",
    "age": 25,
    "city": "New York"
}

# Accessing values
name = person["name"]  # "Alice"
age = person.get("age")  # 25

# Adding/modifying values
person["email"] = "alice@example.com"
person["age"] = 26
---
type: text
---
## Type Conversion
---
type: code
language: python
---
# Convert to string
str(123)  # "123"
str(3.14)  # "3.14"

# Convert to integer
int("42")  # 42
int(3.9)  # 3 (truncates)

# Convert to float
float("3.14")  # 3.14
float(42)  # 42.0
---
type: text
---
## Practice Exercise

Create variables for:
1. Your name (string)
2. Your age (integer)
3. Your favorite programming languages (list)
4. Your skills and proficiency levels (dictionary)

Print all variables and their types using `type()` function.
